• Now you can flip the camera even when you're alone in a group call. Get ready to give them a front-row view by switching to the back camera, or switch back to the front camera so that you're ready to talk back. 
• We fixed a bug that prevented some users from joining a new group or re-joining an existing group, and we also fixed a bug that made it harder to scroll between views during group calls while a hand was raised. These are hands down our favorite bugfixes in this release.
